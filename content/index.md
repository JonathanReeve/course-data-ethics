[Get Started!](#getting-started)

# Description

This interdisciplinary course introduces students to the field of data ethics through an exploration of the societal impacts of data-driven technologies.  This course bridges the philosophy of ethics, humanities and social science scholarship, and computational thinking and practice.  To evaluate writing assignments, the course utilizes the Ethical Reasoning Value Rubric.  The course includes hands-on, guided lab activities where students wrestle with intellectually-challenging ethical questions first-hand.  The course is designed for students from all disciplinary backgrounds and supports the development of introductory computational skill sets for beginners.  An interest in Python is recommended, and a crash course will be provided in Week 3 for students who are new to Python. The course meets twice weekly: once for discussions, and once for a lab. 


# Objectives

At the end of this course, students will be able to: 

 1. Understand ethical challenges posed by the big data era.
 2. Analyze public data critically, with a sensitivity towards social issues.
 3. Develop a clear vision of their own ethical framework, and how best to apply it in the realm of data science.
 4. Develop skills for data analysis in the Python programming language. 

## Prerequisites

This course has no prerequisites. We will use the Python programming language for computational data analysis, and a crash course will be provided for those who are new to Python. 

### Course Communication 

Please direct all questions to our course chatroom on Matrix. 

## Getting Started

1. Sign up for a user account on [hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is), our annotation platform.
2. Sign up for an account on Matrix, and introduce yourself in the course chatroom. 
3. Download and install *[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)*, a Python distribution, which contains a lot of useful data science packages.

## Extra Resources

If you want some extra help, or want to read a little more about some of the things we're doing, there are plenty of resources out there. If you want a second opinion about a question, or have questions that we can't answer in the chatroom, a good website for getting help with programming is [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com). Also, the Internet is full of Python learning resources. One of my favorites is [CodeCademy](https://codecademy.com), which has a game-like interactive interface, badges, and more. There's also the fantastic interactive textbook [How to Think Like a Computer Scientist](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/thinkcspy/index.html), which is the textbook for *Computing in Context,* the introduction to Python at Columbia's Computer Science department.

Jonathan Reeve and a colleague have also put together a few guides for beginning programming: 

 - [Common Error Messages and How to Fix Them](https://github.com/JonathanReeve/course-computational-literary-analysis/blob/master/Resources/errors.md)
 - [A glossary of frequently used Python terminology](https://github.com/JonathanReeve/course-computational-literary-analysis/blob/master/Resources/frequently_used_terms.md)


## Requirements

Coursework falls into three categories:

 - Weekly readings and annotations (30% of final grade) 
 - Lab assignments (10 total) (30% of final grade)
 - Final project (30% of final grade)
 - Attendance and participation (10% of final grade)

### Readings and Annotations

For each reading assignment, please write **2-3 annotations to our editions of the text**, using [hypothes.is](http://hypothes.is). 

Links to the texts are provided below. You'll have to sign up for a hypothes.is account first. **Please use your real name as your username**, so I know who you are. You may write about anything you want, but it will help your final project to think about ethical problems. Good annotations are:

  - Concise (think: a long tweet)
  - Well-written (although not too formal)
  - Observant (rather than evaluative)

You may respond to another student's annotation for one or two of your annotations, if you want. Just make your responses equally as thoughtful.

### Lab Assignments

Lab assignments are introduced during our lab sessions. These are due every week, one week after they're assigned. Please submit all homework on CourseWorks. 

### Final Project

Your final project will be a focused exploration of a public data set, accompanied by a discussion of the ethical issues that surround it. 

During the final week of class, we'll have final project presentations. Your paper isn't required to be complete by then, but you'll be expected to speak about your project for 4 minutes. Consider it a conference presentation.

Final project papers will be evaluated according to the:

  - Quality of the computational data analysis
  - Quality of your interpretation of the data
  - Integration of the computational analysis with the interpretation
  - Your nuanced and well-rounded ethical engagement with the topic

As with homework, please submit these on CourseWorks. You may optionally submit your final project to the course git repository, making it public, for a 5% bonus.
