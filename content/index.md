[Get Started!](#getting-started)

# Description

This interdisciplinary mentored research experience introduces students to the field of data ethics through an exploration of the societal impacts of data-driven technologies. It aims to bridge the philosophy of ethics, humanities and social science scholarship, and computational thinking and practice. We include hands-on, guided lab activities where students wrestle with intellectually-challenging ethical questions first-hand. The research experience is designed for students from all disciplinary backgrounds and supports the development of introductory computational skill sets for beginners. An interest in Python is recommended, and a crash course will be provided for students who are new to Python. 

# Objectives

By the end of the semester, students will be able to: 

 1. Understand ethical challenges posed by the big data era.
 2. Analyze public data critically, with a sensitivity towards social issues.
 3. Develop a clear vision of their own ethical framework, and how best to apply it in the realm of data science.
 4. Develop skills for data analysis in the Python programming language. 

# Requirements

The class is Pass/Fail. To earn a passing grade, you must write 2 annotations on each required reading (2 readings per week). (Further details are in the section [Readings and Annotations](#readings-and-annotations), below.) You can skip 1 week, no questions asked. You are also required to attend ten out of our twelve class sessions, and actively participate in the discussion and lab activity, including serving as discussion leader for one or more readings. 

## Readings and Annotations

For each reading, please write **2-3 annotations to our editions of the text**, using [hypothes.is](http://hypothes.is). Annotations are not required for videos or other non-textual websites. Links to the texts are provided below. You'll have to sign up for a hypothes.is account first. **Please use your real name as your username**, so we know who you are. You may write about anything you want, but it will help to think about ethical problems. Good annotations are:

  - Concise (think: a long tweet)
  - Well-written
  - Observant, rather than evaluative

You may respond to another student's annotation for one or two of your annotations, if you want. Just make your responses equally as thoughtful.

# Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites. We will use the Python programming language for computational data analysis, and a crash course will be provided for those who are new to Python, on Feb. 5th and 6th. 

# Communication 

Please direct all questions to our course chatroom on Matrix.

# Getting Started

1. Sign up for a user account on [hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is), our annotation platform. Please use your real name as your username. 
2. Sign up for an account on Matrix, and introduce yourself in the course chatroom. 
3. Download and install *[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)*, a Python distribution, which contains a lot of useful data science packages.

# Extra Resources

If you want some extra help, or want to read a little more about some of the things we're doing, there are plenty of resources out there. If you want a second opinion about a question, or have questions that we can't answer in the chatroom, a good website for getting help with programming is [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com). Also, the Internet is full of Python learning resources. One of my favorites is [CodeCademy](https://codecademy.com), which has a game-like interactive interface, badges, and more. There's also the fantastic interactive textbook [How to Think Like a Computer Scientist](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/thinkcspy/index.html), which is the textbook for *Computing in Context,* the introduction to Python at Columbia's Computer Science department.

Jonathan Reeve and a colleague have also put together a few guides for beginning programming: 

 - [Common Error Messages and How to Fix Them](https://github.com/JonathanReeve/course-computational-literary-analysis/blob/master/Resources/errors.md)
 - [A glossary of frequently used Python terminology](https://github.com/JonathanReeve/course-computational-literary-analysis/blob/master/Resources/frequently_used_terms.md)
