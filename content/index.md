[Get Started!](#getting-started)

## Description

This course introduces students to the field of data ethics through an exploration of the societal impacts of data-driven technologies.  This interdisciplinary course bridges the philosophy of ethics, humanities and social science scholarship, and computational thinking and practice.  The course includes hands-on, guided lab activities where students will wrestle with intellectually-challenging ethical questions first-hand.  The course is designed for students from every discipline and will support the development of introductory computational skill sets for beginners. 

## Objectives


## Prerequisites

This course presumes no prior knowledge of programming, computer science, or quantitative disciplines. Those with programming experience, however, won't find this boring: the level of specialization is such that only the first few weeks cover the basics.


### Course Communication 

Please direct all questions to Ed Discussions, our course's question-and-answer platform. 

### Labs


## Getting Started

Now that we have that, let's get started! First, let's set up a couple of accounts:


2.  [Create a GitHub account](https://github.com/signup?user_email=&source=form-home-signup). Unless you're already well-established there, **please use your real name (or English name / preferred name, etc) as your username, and add a picture of yourself**.
3.  Use that account to log into [our Zulip chatroom](https://icla2021.zulipchat.com/). (Click "sign up," then "sign up with GitHub.")
4.  Introduce yourself to everyone in the chatroom.
5.  Sign up for a user account on [hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is), our annotation platform.
6.  Download and install *[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)*, a Python distribution, which contains a lot of useful data science packages.

## Extra Resources

### Programming Resources

If you want some extra help, or want to read a little more about some of the things we're doing, there are plenty of resources out there. If you want a second opinion about a question, or have questions that we can't answer in the chatroom, a good website for getting help with programming is [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com). Also, the Internet is full of Python learning resources. One of my favorites is [CodeCademy](https://codecademy.com), which has a game-like interactive interface, badges, and more. There's also the fantastic interactive textbook [How to Think Like a Computer Scientist](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/thinkcspy/index.html), which is the textbook for *Computing in Context,* the introduction to Python at Columbia's Computer Science department.

A colleague and I have also put together a few guides for beginning programming: 

 - [Common Error Messages and How to Fix Them](https://github.com/JonathanReeve/course-computational-literary-analysis/blob/master/Resources/errors.md)
 - [A glossary of frequently used Python terminology](https://github.com/JonathanReeve/course-computational-literary-analysis/blob/master/Resources/frequently_used_terms.md)


## Requirements

Coursework falls into three categories:

 - Weekly readings and annotations (30% of final grade) 
 - Lab assignments (10 total) (30% of final grade)
 - Final project (30% of final grade)
 - Attendance and participation (10% of final grade)

### Readings


### Annotations

For each reading assignment, please write **2-3 annotations to our editions of the text**, using [hypothes.is](http://hypothes.is). 

Links are provided below. You'll have to sign up for a hypothes.is account first. As above, please use your real name as your username, so I know who you are. You may write about anything you want, but it will help your final project to think about ethical problems. Good annotations are:

  - Concise (think: a long tweet)
  - Well-written (although not too formal)
  - Observant (rather than evaluative)

You may respond to another student's annotation for one or two of your annotations, if you want. Just make your responses equally as thoughtful.

### Homework


### Final Project

During the final week of class, we'll have final project presentations. Your paper isn't required to be complete by then, but you'll be expected to speak about your project for 4 minutes. Consider it a conference presentation.

Final papers will be evaluated according to the:

  - Quality of the literary critical argument presented
  - Quality of the close readings of the text or corpus
  - Quality of the Python text analysis
  - Literary interpretation of the results
  - Integration of the computational analysis with the literary argument

As with homework, please submit these on CourseWorks, or email them to me if you don't have access to CourseWorks. You may optionally submit your final project to the course git repository, making it public, for a 5% bonus.
